D1E1 Print the following: -  “Hello ATS Team” 

D1E2 Create a string, integer and float. Print String only if it is “hello”, print integer if it is 2020 and print float if it is 1.0 

D1E3 Input two numbers and perform addition, multiplication 

D2E1  Concatenate two lists on each index 
    list1 = ["A", "B", "C", "D"]  
    list2 = ["E", "F", "G", "H"] 

    Expected op:  >> ['AE', 'BF', 'CG', 'DH'] 

D2E2  Print 

        1  

        1 2  

        1 2 3  

        1 2 3 4  

        1 2 3 4 5 

D2E3  For an input string count all upper case, lower case, numbers, and special characters 

D3E1  Write a recursive function calculating the sum of numbers from 2 to 20 

D3E2   Given a list iterate it and display numbers which are divisible by 3 and if you find number greater     than 150 stop the loop iteration 

list1 = [12, 14, 33, 43, 55, 75, 99, 132, 150, 180, 200] 

D3E3  Describe the scope of the variables a, b, c and d in this example: 

        def my_function(a):     

        b = a - 2 

        return b 

            c = 3 

        

            if c > 2:     

        d = my_function(5) 

        print(d) 

        What is the lifetime of these variables? When will they be created and destroyed? 

        Can you guess what would happen if we were to assign c a value of 1 instead? 

        Why would this be a problem? Can you think of a way to avoid it?
